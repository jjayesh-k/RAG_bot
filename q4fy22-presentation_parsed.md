## Expect significant improvement in sales, profit, cash flow over FY23

Specific supply issues and Range Rover Sport changeover expected to limit improvement in Q1

## OUTLOOK (FY23)

- Ongoing supply challenges compounded by the conflict in Ukraine and China covid lockdowns
- Commodity inflation likely to remain at elevated levels
- Specific new supply chain issues (e.g. China lockdowns) and New Range Rover Sport changeover expected to limit volume i n c r e a s e s   i n   Q 1   p o s s i b l y   r e s u l t i n g   i n   n e g a t i v e   E B I T   a n d   n e g a t i v e   f r e e   c a s h   f l o w   i n   t h e   q u a r t e r
- However, volumes expected to progressively increase thereafter and we target achieving a 5% EBIT margin and £1bn+ positive free cash flow in FY23 for the full year
- Continue to target improving EBIT margin to double digits by FY26 and improving cash flow to achieve near zero net debt in FY24

## PRIORITIES

- Continue to engage with Tier 1 and chip suppliers to increase supply of chips and mitigate other supply chain disruptions
- Refocus savings, including price increases, of £1bn+ to offset cost inflation
- Successful launch and deliveries of the New Range Rover and New Range Rover Sport
